### Tech

PWAConverter uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Font Awesome v5](https://fontawesome.com/) - Beautiful icon library and toolkit
* [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/) - Pico.css is a minimal css framework for semantic html
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A low-level CSS framework that's entirely utility-first and provides users with low-level CSS classes in PostCSS that can be used to define components and designs independently.
* [JSZip](https://stuk.github.io/jszip/) - Package zip files locally in javascript
* [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/) - JSZip comes prebuilt with this. Allows us to save files locally in Javascript
